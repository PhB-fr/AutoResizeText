# AutoResizeText
Resize automatically the text size inside a TextView for Android versions before Oreo.

        Android O introduces the ability to dynamically adjust the text size of a TexView.
        For the older versions, I wrote my own implementation.

In order to test it, you can load the demo project zip file.

If it is okay for you, feel free to use the java class file inside your project and the new AutoResizeTextView in your layouts.

Enjoy !
